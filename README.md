These are all the programming assignments I completed for the book "Starting out with Java", sixth edition by Tony Gaddis

<br />

<p align="center">How to run these programs from the terminal</p>
First, check if you have Java installed. 
Run 

```
$ java --version
``` 
or
```
$ javac --version
```

from the command line.<br />
If you don't have Java installed, open up your browser and search for "jdk download". JDK stands for Java Development Kit. 
You will be able to download it from Oracle.<br />
To run any of the files from the command line, compile it with the
```
$ javac filename.java
```
then run it with
```
$ java filename
```
<br />
