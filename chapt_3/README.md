These are all the programming assignments I completed for the book "Starting out with Java", by Tony Gaddis<br />

<p align="center">Chapter 3 Programming Assignments</p>

<span>1.</span> Roman Numerals <br />
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a number within the range of 1 through 10.
The program should display the Roman numeral version of that number. If the number is
outside the range of 1 through 10, the program should display an error message.
<br />

<span>6.</span> Time Calculator <br />
Write a program that asks the user to enter a number of seconds.
• There are 60 seconds in a minute. If the number of seconds entered by the user is
greater than or equal to 60, the program should display the number of minutes in that
many seconds.
• There are 3,600 seconds in an hour. If the number of seconds entered by the user is
greater than or equal to 3,600, the program should display the number of hours in
that many seconds.
• There are 86,400 seconds in a day. If the number of seconds entered by the user is
greater than or equal to 86,400, the program should display the number of days in
that many seconds.
<br />

<span>7.</span> Odd Number <br />
Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, and then checks whether it is an odd number or not. If the number is odd, the program should display “The number is an odd number.”
<br />

<span>11.</span> Leap Year <br />
Write a program that asks the user to enter a year and then checks whether it is a leap year
or not. If it is a leap year, the program should display the message “The year is a leap year.”
To determine if a year is a leap year:
- Determine whether the year is divisible by 100. If it is, then it is a leap year if and if
only, it is divisible by 400. For example, 2000 is a leap year but 2100 is not.
- If the year is not divisible by 100, then it is a leap year if and if only it is divisible by
4. For example, 2008 is a leap year but 2009 is not.
<br />

<span>16.</span> Book Club Points <br />
Serendipity Booksellers has a book club that awards points to its customers based on the
number of books purchased each month. The points are awarded as follows:
• If a customer purchases 0 books, he or she earns 0 points.
• If a customer purchases 1 book, he or she earns 5 points.
• If a customer purchases 2 books, he or she earns 15 points.
• If a customer purchases 3 books, he or she earns 30 points.
• If a customer purchases 4 or more books, he or she earns 60 points.
